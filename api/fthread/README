Since release 2.4d, Bigloo supports threads. Please refer to the
Bigloo manual for any question regarding thread API and the thread
semantics.

The Bigloo threads implementation requires a support for native
Posix threads from the host operating system, except for JVM and
.NET back-ends. In consequence the thread implementation is uneasy
to port. Here is the list of platforms that support threads:

	- the JVM and .NET back-ends on *all* platforms

	- Linux/x86

	- Solaris

	- HP-UX

	- Win32 in the Windows version of Bigloo

Please refer to the fthread/INSTALL file for any information about
the Bigloo fair threads installation.
