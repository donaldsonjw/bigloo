This is a straightforward implementation of the Posix Threads in Bigloo.
This is not to be confused with the Fair Threads which constitutes the 
"official" Bigloo's concurrent programming model.

The Bigloo threads implementation requires a support for native
Posix threads from the host operating system, except for JVM and
.NET back-ends. In consequence the thread implementation is uneasy
to port.
