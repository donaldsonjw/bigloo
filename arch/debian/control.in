Description: a practical Scheme compiler
 Bigloo is a Scheme implementation devoted to one goal: enabling
 Scheme based programming style where C(++) is usually
 required. Bigloo attempts to make Scheme practical by offering
 features usually presented by traditional programming languages but
 not offered by Scheme and functional programming. Bigloo compiles
 Scheme modules. It delivers small and fast stand alone binary
 executables. Bigloo enables full connections between Scheme and C
 programs, between Scheme and Java programs, and between Scheme and C#
 programs.
 .
 The Bigloo C code generator delivers fast binaries executables for
 the Unix operating system. The Bigloo JVM code generator delivers
 highly portable JVM class files (or jar files) that can be run on any
 JVM runtime environment (Sun's JDK, Netscape Applets, etc.). We have
 measured that in general, Scheme modules when compiled to JVM are in
 between 2 and 4 times slower than their C counterpart.
 .
 The list of features is available at:
