This directory contains the source files of Cigloo, a translator from
C to Bigloo. Cigloo scans C files and produces Bigloo foreign clauses.

In order to compile Cigloo, Bigloo (release 1.9 c) must have been
already installed.  To compile Cigloo just enter `make'.

To install Cigloo just enter `make install'. 

Note: Normally cigloo must be installed before the Bigloo compilation
files are cleared. If it happens that you try to install cigloo after
removing Bigloo compilation file, type 
   `make install BINDIR=<the-bin-directory-you-want>'. 
Otherwise you will be prompted an error message during the installation 
process.
