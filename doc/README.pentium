In order to improve the performance of Bigloo, when configuring it you should
use:

   ./configure --arch=pIII

of

   ./configure --arch=pIV

Depending of your hardware setting. The drawback of this configuration
is that the compiler and Bigloo programs linked against the static
library won't run on non-PIII/PIV platforms.
