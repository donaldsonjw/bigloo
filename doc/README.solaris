To build Bigloo on Solaris, you must use the following GNU tools:

  - "gtar" instead of "tar"
  - "gpatch" instead of "patch"
  - "gmake" instead of "make"

To instruct Bigloo's configure script to use the first two, one may use:

  $ export TAR=gtar
  $ export PATH=gpatch
  $ ./configure

Then, invoke gmake with

  $ gmake
