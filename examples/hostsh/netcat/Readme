Build a (gnu) netcat for the host-platform.
Copy netcat, host.sh, host_exec.sh to the host.
Run ./host.sh path_to_netcat

From this moment on, the host is waiting for files to execute.

On the build-side simply run
./configure --hostsh="path_to_build.sh ip-address_of_target" ....

During configuration the build.sh will copy (through netcat) the files to
 the host and execute the files there.

Note: this is a dirty script that worked quite well on my machine. However,
it does not follow the same quality-guidelines as the rest of Bigloo.
Be prepared to adapt/debug the script if it does not work.

With this in mind: good luck.
