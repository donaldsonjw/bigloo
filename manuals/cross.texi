@chapter Cross Compilation
@cindex cross compilation

Bigloo is very portable and can be cross-compiled for most
Posix-platforms. As long as there exists a C (cross-)compiler for the
platform and the garbage collector is supported on the targeted
platform there is a good chance that Bigloo or Bigloo-compiled
programs will run on the platform.

This chapter describes how to cross-compile Bigloo with a C
cross-compiler. Following established conventions we will call the
platform where the compiled programs should run the @emph{Host}
platform and we will call the build platform where we actually compile
the programs the @emph{Build} platform.

@section Introduction
We assume that the host- and build-system are not the same, and that
there exists a C cross-compiler @code{CC} running on the build system
producing executables for the host system.

In order to execute programs on the host, it is however not sufficient
to simply compile Bigloo-produced programs with this compiler. Indeed,
these programs depend on the Bigloo-library which thus has to exist
on the host-platform.

Building a cross-compilation environment is done in two phases:
@itemize @bullet
@item Build a Bigloo for the build-platform. Usually this is a given.
@item Build the Bigloo library for the host-platform. At the same time
one might want to build the Bigloo-executable (for the host-platform)
too, but this is not a requirement.
@end itemize

Programs can then be cross-compiled simply by telling Bigloo to use
the host-library.

Note: if the cross-compiled executable uses shared libraries, then
Bigloo's cross-compiled libraries have to be copied to the host
platform. Static executables are self-contained and can be run without
modification on the host.

@section Building the Bigloo library for the host-platform
We assume that we have a C cross-compiler @code{CC} and an empty
Bigloo source tree. As a first step the configuration script must be
executed. However, Bigloo's configure script requires some
runtime-information from the host and thus needs access to the
host-machine. This is accomplished by passing a hostsh-script to
configure.

@subsection Hostsh
A @emph{hostsh} script is passed to Bigloo's configuration script and
is invoked whenever a command should be executed on the host-side.

There are already three example scripts inside Bigloo's source
tree.
@itemize @bullet
@item one asks (using KDE's kdialog) to execute the command by hand on
the host-side and to report the result.
@item another one copies the file by @code{ssh} and executes it then
on the other side. Note: there exists an Ipod/Iphone version that
automatically signs on jail-broken devices.
@item and finally, as last resort, there exists a @code{netcat}
version if no @code{ssh} is available. This one can be used on devices
that only have telnet access, and where ssh is not available. Its only
requirement is a running netcat on the host-side (which should be
easily achievable since there exists a working cross compiler).
@end itemize

@subsection Building
Armed with a working cross-compiler @code{CC} and a script
@code{HOSTSH} that invokes commands and executables on the host side
the configure invocation is simple:

@display
./configure --prefix=[PREFIX_PATH_ON_TARGET] --hostsh=[HOSTSH] --cc=[CC]
@end display

Other configuration options are of course possible too.

Once the configuration has finished one can build Bigloo (and its
library) simply by calling @code{make}. This will build the libraries
as well as the binaries.

If shared libraries are needed on the host platform one still needs to
install them. The easiest way is probably to install them temporary on
a build system inside a special directory and then copy them from
there to the host system.

@display
make DESTDIR=[temporary-directory] install
@end display

Only the @code{lib} directory is needed on the host side.

@section Cross Compiling Bigloo Programs
Once the host-library exists cross compilation is straightforward.
Using the @code{-lib-dir} compilation flag one simply has to pass the
library-directory to Bigloo.

@display
bigloo -lib-dir [path-to-cross-compiled-library] ....
@end display

Bigloo will automatically use the same C cross-compiler and
compilation flags that have been used to build the library.

@section Caveats
In general Bigloo's cross-compilation works fine, but developers
should be aware of some limitations:

@itemize @bullet
@item Macros will be executed on the build platform. The
macro-environment (and in particular its integer types) might not be
the same. For instance an @code{elong} on the build-system might be of
different size than an @code{elong} on the host-system.
@item Bigloo will read numbers on the build system and adapt the
container size accordingly. Suppose for instance that the build system
features 64bit longs, but the host system only allows for 32bit
longs. The number 2^35 fits easily into a long on the build-system but
will overflow on the host-system. The container will however be
determined on the build system and thus a long will be used. This is
only a problem for big integer literals.
@item A cross-compiled Bigloo uses (by default) the same C compiler
that has been used to compile the Bigloo. Once the executable has been
transferred to the host-system the C cross-compiler does very likely
not exist anymore. Therefore Bigloo will need to be invoked with the
@code{-cc} flag on the host-system (under the assumption that there
exists a C compiler).

This drawback can be eliminated by directly
compiling Bigloo on the host (since there exists a C compiler).
@end itemize

@section Examples
In this example we will show how to compile for a host-machine that
has ssh-access.

We assume
@itemize
@item a working Bigloo (should be the same version as the one
that is going to be compiled for the host) in the PATH.
@item ssh access to the host. This access should be without password
(using keys). The system should be accessible by @code{ssh [host]}
(where @code{[host]} should be replaced with the correct address).
@item a C cross-compiler @code{CC} running on the build-system and
compiling for the host.
@end itemize

With these preconditions satisfied we can first build Bigloo for the host-system:
@display
$ ./configure --hostsh="$PWD/examples/hostsh/ssh/ssh-copy.sh [host]" --cc=[CC]
$ make
$ make DESTDIR=[TMP] install
@end display

Now let's compile a simple hello-world for the host.

@display
$ cat > /tmp/hello.scm <<EOF
(module hello (main main))
(define (main args) (print "hello world"))
EOF

$ bigloo -static-all-bigloo -lib-dir [TMP]/lib/3.2c/ -o /tmp/hello /tmp/hello.scm
@end display

The generated executable should be able to run on the host.
