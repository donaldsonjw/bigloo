This section describes two Posix-Like multi-threading Bigloo libraries.
The two libraries, @code{pthread}, and @code{srfi-18} are all the same
but the @code{mutex-state} function that returns different results.
Because of these differences that might seem thin at first glance,
the @code{pthread} library is significantly faster than the @code{srfi-18}
library. For that reason, it is recommended to use the @code{pthread}
library instead of the @code{srfi-18} library that is mostly supported
for backward compatibility.

As much as possible, the names exported by this library are compatible
with the Fair Threads library (see Section @ref{Fair Threads}).

@subsection Using Posix Threads

The Bigloo modules initialization model does not permit to create threads
before the main function is started. In other words, it is unsafe
to use the Posix Threads API at the top level of modules. On some particular
applications this might work correctly. On other it could produce
an error message stating the threads cannot be created or started before
the pthread library is initialized.

@subsection Threads

@deffn {Bigloo syntax} instantiate::pthread (body @var{thunk}) [(name @var{name})]
@deffnx {SRFI-18 function} make-thread @var{thunk} [@var{name}]
Returns a new thread which is not started yet. The body of the thread
is the body of the procedure @var{thunk}. The optional argument @var{name}
can be use to identify the thread. It can be any Bigloo value.

@b{Warning:} the @code{make-thread} function is @b{deprecated}, but
still provided for a backward compatibility with previous release of
Bigloo. The use of this function is @emph{highly} discouraged, in
favor of the @code{instantiate::pthread} form.

@smalllisp
(module example
   (library pthread)
   (main main))

(define (main argv)
   (make-thread 
    (lambda () 
       (print 1)
       (thread-yield!)
       (print 2)) 
    'my-thread))
@end smalllisp
@end deffn

@deffn {SRFI-18 function} thread-start! @var{thread}
@deffnx {SRFI-18 function} thread-start-joinable! @var{thread}
Runs a thread created with @code{instantiate::pthread}. By default,
threads are detached, and thus, they cannot be joined.
@end deffn

@deffn {SRFI-18 function} thread-yield!
The current thread @emph{cooperates}. 
@end deffn

@deffn {SRFI-18 function} thread-sleep! @var{timeout}

The current thread @emph{sleeps} for a certain period. It is suspended
and the scheduler is free to select a new thread to be resumed. If
there is only one thread started in the scheduler, the same thread
will be resumed.  The time of @var{timeout} is used to determine the
time the thread must sleep.

Here are the possible types for @var{timeout}.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{date}: the thread sleeps at least until the date @var{timeout}.
@item @code{real}: the thread sleeps at least @var{timeout} seconds.
@item @code{fixum}, @code{elong}, @code{llong}: the thread sleeps at least
@var{timeout} milli-seconds.
@end itemize

@end deffn

@deffn {SRFI-18 function} thread-terminate! @var{thread}
Terminates @var{thread} as soon as possible.
@end deffn

@deffn {SRFI-18 function} thread-join! @var{thread} [@var{timeout}]
The current thread waits until the @var{thread} terminates. If @var{thread}
terminates, @code{thread-join!} returns the end-result of the @var{thread}
or the end-exception if that thread terminates abnormally.

It is possible to wait for the termination of the a thread if and only if
it has been started with @code{thread-start-joinable!}. In particular,
threads started with @code{thread-start!} cannot be joined.

The optional argument @var{timeout}, forces to wait at for
@var{timeout} milli-seconds for the thread to terminate. Note that not
all systems support this facility. When supported, the
@code{cond-expand} (see @pxref{SRFIs}) @code{pthread-timedjoin} is
defined. When the timeout expires some systems, raise an error. Other
systems abort silently.

@c -- Mutexes -------------------------------------------------------- @c
@node Mutexes API, Condition Variables API, Threads API, Posix Threads
@subsection Mutexes
Thread locking mechanism is common to Fair Threads and Posix Threads
(see @ref{Thread Common Functions}).

@deffn {SRFI-18 function} {mutex-state} mutex
Returns the symbol @code{locked} when the mutex is locked by a thread.
Otherwise, it returns the symbol @code{unlocked}.
@end deffn

@c -- Condition Variables -------------------------------------------- @c
@node Condition Variables API, SRFI-18, Mutexes API, Posix Threads
@subsection Condition Variables

Posix thread condition variables follows the common thread API
(see @ref{Thread Common Functions}).

@smalllisp
(module example
  (library pthread)
  (main main))

(define (main argv)
   (let ((res #f)
	 (lock (make-mutex))
	 (cv (make-condition-variable)))
      (thread-join!
       (thread-start-joinable!
	(instantiate::pthread
	   (body (lambda ()
		    (mutex-lock! lock)
		    (thread-start!
		     (instantiate::pthread
			(body (lambda ()
				 (mutex-lock! lock)
				 (condition-variable-signal! cv)
				 (mutex-unlock! lock)))))
		    (condition-variable-wait! cv lock)
		    (set! res 23) 
		    (mutex-unlock! lock))))))
      res))
@end smalllisp

@c -- Condition Variables -------------------------------------------- @c
@node SRFI-18, , Condition Variables API, Posix Threads
@subsection SRFI-18

@deffn {SRFI-18 function} {mutex-state} mutex

Returns information about the state of the mutex. The possible results are:

@itemize @bullet
 @item thread T: the mutex is in the locked/owned state and thread T is the owner of the mutex
 @item symbol @code{not-owned}: the mutex is in the locked/not-owned state
 @item symbol @code{abandoned}: the mutex is in the unlocked/abandoned state
 @item symbol @code{not-abandoned}: the mutex is in the unlocked/not-abandoned state 
@end itemize

Examples:

@smalllisp
(mutex-state (make-mutex))  
   @result{} not-abandoned

(define (thread-alive? thread)
   (let ((mutex (make-mutex)))
      (mutex-lock! mutex #f thread)
      (let ((state (mutex-state mutex)))
         (mutex-unlock! mutex) ; avoid space leak
         (eq? state thread))))

@end smalllisp

@end deffn
