This directory contains an example of connecting Bigloo and the Xlib.
It uses Cigloo, the C to Bigloo foreign clauses translator. The connection
is declared in one Bigloo include file named `xlib.sch' which is 
automatically produced.

Before creating the `xlib.sch' file you need to have already
installed both Bigloo and Cigloo. To create the `xlib.sch' file, edit
the Makefile and set the variables `INCLUDEDIR' and `XINCLUDEDIR' to the
appropriate value according to your configuration. Then just type `make'.

When the `xlib.sch' is created, you can install it in the current
Bigloo libraries directory using the command `make install'.
